Before SQL, the landscape of data management and querying was quite different. Here are a few key methods and technologies that were used before SQL became widely adopted:

1. **Hierarchical and Network Databases**: In the 1960s and early 1970s, hierarchical and network databases were popular. These systems organized data in tree-like structures (hierarchical) or graph-like structures (network), where relationships between data elements were defined explicitly. Examples include IBM's IMS (Information Management System) and CODASYL (Conference on Data Systems Languages) databases.

2. **Navigational Languages**: Users interacted with hierarchical and network databases using navigational languages. These languages required programmers to specify paths to navigate through the data structure to retrieve or manipulate data. Examples include CODASYL's Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Query-By-Example (QBE) for simple querying.

3. **Flat Files and Sequential Access**: Before databases became prevalent, data was often stored in flat files (text files) or in sequential formats on tapes or disks. Accessing and manipulating these files required writing custom programs in languages like COBOL, Fortran, or assembly language.

4. **Inverted Lists and Indexing**: For information retrieval systems and some early database systems, inverted lists and indexing techniques were used to facilitate fast access to data based on key attributes. These methods were often used in conjunction with flat files and custom data structures.

5. **Early Query Languages**: Before SQL standardized querying, there were attempts to create query languages. For example, IBM's SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) was one such language that evolved into SQL. Other languages included QUEL (Query Language) used in Ingres, a precursor to relational databases.

SQL emerged as a standardized and more user-friendly alternative to these methods, providing a declarative way to query and manipulate data stored in relational databases. Its simplicity, efficiency, and standardized syntax contributed significantly to its widespread adoption and eventual dominance in the database management field.
